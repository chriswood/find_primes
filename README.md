find_primes
===========

Find a particular prime, or a series of them.

This is meant to be fun and a learning process, so I'm not just blindly copying algorithms off the internet.

I'm going to see what I can figure out, then add some code to run things how the "pros" do :)

Things to try...

1) "Brute Force"
For a given integer n, 
    a) run basic checks (ends in 5, divisible by 3,...)
    b) try dividing every number up to n/2 (or (n/2)-1)
